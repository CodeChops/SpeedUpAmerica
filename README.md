# SpeedUp Your City

The project vision is an open source nation-wide map that pulls individual internet speed test data from [M-Lab](https://viz.measurementlab.net/location/nauskylouisville?isps=AS10796x_AS10774x_AS11486x) and breaking down the results on maps and charts by points, census blocks, ISP, date range, and speed.  Census block data and [FCC 477](https://www.fcc.gov/general/broadband-deployment-data-fcc-form-477) data will used to supplement both the analysis and maps.

The current implentation of SpeedUp has been deployed to these cities.

## Digital Inclusion

The project can be used as part of a digital inclusion strategy to learn where inequities are in your community.  SpeedUp can help citizens, businesses, policymakers and others better understand where Louisville residents can access high-quality Internet service, and where there are needs, allowing cities to track and improve performance through key policies, ISP agreements, and partnerships.

### Replace FCC 477 Data

All current digital inclusion maps rely on [FCC 477](https://www.fcc.gov/general/broadband-deployment-data-fcc-form-477) data which is ISP self-reported, notriously incomplete, misleading, gameable by ISPs, and not detailed enough.  Let's get better, more accurate, crowd-source speed data directly from citizens to make better decisions and drive policy.

## Project History

In April 2016, Louisville Metro Government’s OPI2 Innovation Team,  PowerUp Labs and other partners launched a web-based application aimed to increase transparency about Internet service quality in Louisville at a hackathon. Louisville worked partners to open source "SpeedUp" so that any local government or organization can launch this application for their community.

The application, SpeedUpLouisville.com, the local deployment of "SpeedUp", collects and publicly shares user-generated information about local broadband service speeds, rates and service quality in Louisville. It also incorporates the Measurement Lab Test, which is integrated with Google.com, and greatly increases the number of tests that the application collects.

## About the Speed Test and the Data

The data is displayed on an interactive map and available for free download, with the goal of increasing transparency about Internet service quality in Louisville and to continue the conversation around fiber in your community.
Citizens can visit the site from any device to take the free Internet service test, and is supplemented by Google's M-Lab tests. The data provided by the test and short survey is stored in a publicly available database, combined with other results, and published to the online map in a form that does not identify contributors, and allows direct raw data download.

This test does not collect information about personal Internet traffic such as emails, web searches, or other personally identifiable information. 

## About the Original Developers

The SpeedUpLouisville.com  project started at a local civic hackathon led by the Civic Data Alliance and hosted by Code Louisville and Code for America. Eric Littleton, Jon Matar and the PowerUp Labs software development team later volunteered to continue the work started during the hackathon. LVL1, a local makerspace, also provided funding for the paid web tools required to complete the project.
